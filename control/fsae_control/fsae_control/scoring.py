scoring.py — Live-run copy of fsae_MPCTest/sim/scoring.py

PURPOSE
-------
Scores a LIVE (real/simulated-car) run with the exact same maths the offline
tuner uses to score a simulated rollout, so a number produced on the car is
directly comparable to a number produced by offline_tuner.py.  Without this,
"the sim says 42, the car feels worse" is unfalsifiable.

PARITY — THIS IS A VERBATIM COPY
--------------------------------
compute_composite_score(), RolloutMetrics.add_step() and
RolloutMetrics.finalize() below are copied byte-for-byte (modulo the
settings import, see below) from fsae_MPCTest/sim/scoring.py.  Do NOT
"improve" them here.  Any change to scoring must be made in
fsae_MPCTest/sim/scoring.py first and then re-copied across, exactly like
mpc_core.py mirrors the offline MPC — otherwise live and offline scores stop
being comparable, which defeats the entire point of the file.

The ONE intentional difference: fsae_MPCTest imports SCORE_WEIGHTS and the
bonus/penalty constants from its settings.py, which is not on the live car's
PYTHONPATH.  They are inlined below as module constants instead, and must be
kept numerically identical to fsae_MPCTest/settings.py.

WHAT THE LIVE CAR CANNOT MEASURE
--------------------------------
Two inputs to the offline score have no faithful live equivalent:
  - time_bonus  — needs a known expected lap time / step budget.
  - offtrack    — the offline rollout knows ground-truth track edges.
Both default to 0.0 / False here.  progress and dnf ARE supplied by the
caller where known.  Live scores are therefore comparable to offline scores
in their weighted-metric component; the bonus terms are only comparable when
the caller supplies them.  score_is_partial in the emitted header records
this so a reader can't mistake one for the other.

-------
  telemetry_logger.ControlLogger — accumulates per control step and writes the
                                   finalised score as a header on the CSV.
