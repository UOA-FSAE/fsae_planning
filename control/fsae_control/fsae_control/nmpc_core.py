# Title: nmpc_core.py

"""
nmpc_core.py — NONLINEAR model-predictive path-tracking controller
(Frenet-frame / curvilinear coordinates, Gauss-Newton SQP, condensed dense QP
subproblem solved by OSQP).

This is a SECOND, independently selectable controller. It does not modify,
subclass or import behaviour from mpc_core.MPCController's solve path: that
LTV-QP controller remains the default and is completely untouched. Selection
happens at node construction time via NMPCParams.use_nmpc (default False) —
see mpc_controller.py / mpc_controller_standalone.py.

WHY IT EXISTS: MPCController's prediction model has no term for the path
itself bending (`e_psi_dot = r`, missing `- kappa(s)*s_dot`), so with the car
dead on-line approaching a corner the QP predicts staying on-line forever and
no cost weighting can produce turn-in before real error exists — measured at
exactly 0.000 deg commanded across 8 synthetic states. Here `kappa(s)` is
looked up against arc length `s`, which is itself a STATE driven by the car's
predicted motion, not indexed by horizon step — so unlike three earlier
attempts to inject curvature as exogenous horizon data (all producing a
wrong-direction transient, see below), the obligation isn't schedulable.
Full derivation, the model equations, the cost construction, and the
real-time SQP structure (roll-forward feasibility, condensing, warm-start,
solve-time budget): `planning_control_sync.md`'s "Nonlinear MPC (use_nmpc)"
section and `late_turn_in_investigation.md` Part 16 (§16.1 gap, §16.3 model,
§16.5 correctness checks, §16.7 solve time/horizon-iteration sweep).

State/input vectors: x = [s, e_y, e_psi, v_x, v_y, r, delta_act, a_act],
u = [delta_cmd, a_cmd]. Every vehicle constant (lf, lr, m, Iz, Cf, Cr,
tau_delta, tau_a, MAX_STEER_RAD, MAX_ACCEL, MAX_BRAKE, du_max) is taken from
MPCController unchanged, including its kinematic/dynamic blend breakpoints —
no new physical constant is introduced. Error measurement (front-axle
projection, e_psi wrap, e_y_dot) is identical to `MPCController._error_state`
so an NMPC log means exactly what an LTV-QP log means. Cost weights come from
the SAME MPCParams the LTV-QP uses — see nmpc_params.py for the per-NMPC
override fields and the one weight whose meaning changes (q_r -> heading-error
rate, not absolute yaw rate).

WHAT THIS CONTROLLER DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
---------------------------------------------
* No adaptive gain schedule (mpc_core's corner-factor/heading-error-asymmetry
  stack) — that exists to synthesise anticipation a curvature-blind model
  can't produce; layering it on a curvature-aware model would double-count an
  effect that's now structural. Left untouched on the LTV-QP path.
* No shaped heading-lead profile. set_heading_profile() is accepted (so the
  nodes need no branch) and IGNORED with a one-time log line — that profile is
  a workaround for the same missing curvature term this controller closes
  structurally.
* No speed profile over the horizon BY DEFAULT. v_ref is the caller's
  single, already low-passed desired_speed held constant across the
  horizon, same as the LTV-QP gets — deliberately not addressing the
  (separate) braking-lag problem here, so a live A/B isolates the
  lateral-model change alone. NMPCParams.nmpc_horizon_speed_profile_enabled
  (default False, EXPERIMENTAL) can opt into a per-stage lookup instead —
  see PathReference.v_ref_at.

EXPERIMENTAL ADDITIONS (all additive, all default to preserve the above
exactly)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* PathReference.__init__ now fits an analytic CubicSpline to the raw
  waypoints by default (NMPCParams.nmpc_spline_reference_enabled, default
  True) instead of the old dense-resample + moving-average +
  finite-difference pipeline — see PathReference's own docstring. The old
  path is kept (not deleted) and selectable via the flag for A/B comparison.
* nmpc_horizon_speed_profile_enabled (default False): see PathReference.v_ref_at.
* nmpc_friction_circle_enabled (default False): an ADDITIONAL hard
  |F_yf|/|F_yr| <= F_max QP constraint on top of (not instead of) the
  existing soft alat-ceiling saturation below — see NH_FRICTION and
  _build_qp/_solve_step.
