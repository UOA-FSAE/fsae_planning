"""
Lightweight CSV telemetry logger for the control nodes (debug/tuning aid).

Both controllers (Stanley, MPC) can write two compact CSVs so planner problems
can be separated from controller problems offline. On close() the control CSV
is rewritten with a scored, commented header block (see "Score header" below).

Why CSV and not rosbag: the tracking errors e_y / e_psi are computed inside the
controller and never published to a topic, so rosbag can't see them, and they
are what distinguishes "path is wiggly" from "controller oscillates". CSV is
also far smaller (~100 KB/min) and directly plottable.

Coordinate frame: everything positional is in the simulator's global ENU frame
(x = east, y = north, yaw zero at +x/east), written with no conversion, so
control rows and path rows overlay directly on one plot. e_y/e_psi are
Frenet-style, measured at the front axle relative to the nearest planner path
segment:
  e_y   > 0  → front axle is to the LEFT of the path      (metres)
  e_psi > 0  → car heading is rotated CCW (left) of the path tangent

Time: `t` is run-relative seconds starting at 0.0 (first logged sample), not a
ROS epoch stamp; the epoch of that origin is preserved in the header as
`t0_epoch_s`. Both CSVs share one origin.

Control CSV columns: t, car_x, car_y, car_yaw, v_actual, v_desired, steer_deg,
e_y, e_psi_deg, yaw_rate, delta_cmd (rad), a_cmd (m/s^2), solver_failed,
inaccurate, plus the latency diagnostics pose_age_s/path_age_s/n_delay/
solve_ms/cmd_latency_ms. delta_cmd/a_cmd are logged in the MPC's own units
rather than normalised FSDS command units so the score can be recomputed from
the file without re-deriving the scaling.

Trailing the above is the adaptive-feature trace — curvature/demand context
plus one column per adaptive multiplier and the resulting absolute weights.
See ADAPTIVE_COLUMNS below for the full list and what each one means
(its tail carries the NMPC-only columns, empty on LTV-QP runs).

Path CSV columns: t, idx, x, y — waypoint snapshots at ~1 Hz.

Units contract: log_control()'s steer_rad/e_psi_rad are radians and converted
to degrees on write. Callers must not pass the normalised ControlCommand.steering
([-1, 1]) — scale it by MAX_STEER_RAD first, or steer_deg silently inflates by
~2.3x while still looking plausible.

Score header: close() prepends a `#`-commented block with the composite score
and every component metric, computed by fsae_control.scoring — a verbatim
copy of fsae_MPCTest/sim/scoring.py, so a live run is directly comparable to
an offline tuner rollout. `pandas.read_csv(path, comment='#')` parses the file
unchanged; numpy's genfromtxt needs `skip_header=<count of '#' lines>` since it
doesn't skip comments when locating the `names=True` row. The car can't
measure `time_bonus` or `offtrack`, so when the caller supplies neither those
terms are 0.0/False and the header records `score_is_partial`.

Config header: right below the score header (see `_write_score_header`),
`ControlLogger.set_config_lines()`/`build_config_lines()` write a
`#`-commented dump of the ENTIRE launch-time configuration this run used —
which controller (Stanley / LTV-QP MPC / NMPC), every `MPCParams`/
`NMPCParams` field (a plain `dataclasses.asdict()` dump, so it never goes
stale when a field is added/removed/retuned), the NMPC's own RESOLVED
weights (post `-1.0`-inherits-from-MPCParams), and the launch-time flags that
pick a path/speed source (`map_path`, `path_map_path`,
`use_precomputed_heading_profile`, `enable_dynamic_speed_cap`, `v_max`,
`v_min`). The goal is that a single CSV, on its own, is enough to reproduce
the exact run it came from — see `build_config_lines()`'s own docstring for
the one thing this does NOT capture (the adaptive-gain SCHEME itself, as
opposed to its numeric weights, since that's code, not a parameter).

# ── Adaptive-feature trace columns ───────────────────────────────────────
# Written from mpc_core's last_telemetry (see its "Adaptive-feature trace"
# comment). Each m_* column is the multiplier that ONE feature applied to ONE
# weight on that tick, so 1.0 means "this feature did nothing here" and the
# product of a weight's m_* columns times its base value is its *_eff column.
# That decomposition is the point: it tells you which feature moved a weight,
# not merely that the weight moved.
#
# Order here defines CSV column order; log_control writes one cell per
# entry, in this order, by looking each key up in the `adaptive` mapping.
# Controllers with no adaptive features (Stanley) pass nothing and every cell
# is written empty, so the column set stays identical across controllers.

        use_precomputed_heading_profile, enable_dynamic_speed_cap,

        such (not skipped), since "map_path was empty" (-> live planner
        mode) is exactly the kind of thing worth being able to read back.
    mpc_params : mpc_params.MPCParams, optional
        Dumped via dataclasses.asdict() -- every field, whatever they
        currently are. This is DELIBERATE: hand-listing field names here
        would silently go stale every time a weight is added, renamed or
        removed (as already happened once this session, see the
        corner_factor rewrite) -- asdict() cannot go stale, it reflects
        whatever MPCParams actually is at import time.
    nmpc_params : nmpc_params.NMPCParams, optional
        Same treatment, only meaningful when controller used_nmpc=True.
    nmpc_effective : dict, optional
        The NMPC's RESOLVED weights after its own `-1.0`-inherits-from-
        MPCParams logic (e.g. {'w_out': ctrl.w_out.tolist(), 'r_delta':
        ctrl.r_delta, ...} read straight off the constructed
        NMPCController) -- logged separately from nmpc_params's raw
        (possibly -1.0) override fields so a reader doesn't have to
        mentally re-run the inheritance to know what was ACTUALLY used.

    What this does NOT capture (read this before assuming the dump is
    complete): the adaptive-gain SCHEME itself -- e.g. today's
    `_corner_factor`/`_blend` continuous blend in mpc_core.py -- is CODE,
    not a parameter, and isn't reproducible from a config dump the way a
    numeric weight is. If the scheme changes (as it already has once this
    session), a config header from an OLDER run describes weights for a
    scheme that no longer exists. `mpc_core.py`'s own module/function
    docstrings are the authoritative description of the CURRENT scheme;
    this dump only ever tells you the NUMBERS that scheme was using.

    Turns a precomputed (path_X, path_Y, path_V) speed profile plus a stream
    of car positions into the progress/reached_end/time_bonus terms
    compute_composite_score() needs, so a live run stops being permanently
    scored as "never finished" (see close()'s previous progress=0.0 default,

    fsae_MPCTest and is not on the live node's PYTHONPATH (see
    CLAUDE.md's scoring-parity note — the car has no fsae_MPCTest checkout).

    (load_speed_profile_csv, precomputed offline by that same solver) to
