class StanleyController:
    """
    Stanley path-tracking steering controller (Thrun et al., DARPA 2005).

    δ = θ_e + arctan(k_cte · e / (v + k_soft))

    θ_e — heading error: path tangent angle minus car yaw (rad).
          Positive when path turns left relative to the car.
    e   — cross-track error: signed lateral distance from the front axle
          to the nearest path point (m), positive when the axle is to
          the RIGHT of the path.
    v   — car speed (m/s); k_soft prevents division by zero at standstill.

    Sign convention (FSDS ENU: x forward, y left):
      output > 0  → steer right
      output < 0  → steer left
      output ∈ [-1, 1]

    Tuning:
      k_cte     — cross-track gain.  Higher values correct lateral error faster
                  but cause oscillation on a high-speed straight.
      k_soft    — speed softening (m/s).  Set to ~walking speed so the CTE
                  term doesn't saturate the steering at low speeds.
      k_d       — yaw-rate damper gain.  Subtracts k_d·ω from the Stanley
                  angle before normalising, opposing rapid heading changes.
                  This is the primary fix for left-right sway: the CTE term
                  alone has no memory of how fast the heading is already
                  changing, so it overshoots; k_d·ω counters each swing.
      wheelbase — distance from rear to front axle (m).  Used to project
                  the control point to the front axle, which is where Stanley
                  measures cross-track error.

    curvature_speed() only looks at the shape of the path ahead, not where the

    a straight while the car is badly off-line. This gate ramps the target
    down (linearly) once |e_y| or |e_psi| exceeds its _lo threshold, taking
    the worse of the two, and saturates at `floor` rather than 0 above _hi —
    the car still needs some speed to steer itself back to the path.

    The five default thresholds are reasonable-default judgement calls, not
    independently measured/tuned: _lo is set well past normal tracking noise
    so the gate doesn't fire during ordinary driving, _hi is set at a clearly
    "badly off" error, and floor stops short of zero so the car never loses

    each corner in the scan window, propagated for braking distance (see below)

    so it has no notion of "car is currently going faster than the profile
    allows and the corner is close enough that it can no longer brake down
    to the profile's target in time." That mismatch is exactly what shows up
    as late, hard braking and steering saturation at corner entry — see

    This is a thin wrapper over curvature_speed() using its own (separate,
    typically tighter) a_lat_max/safety defaults — the oracle profile was
    optimised for the whole lap and is trusted as the primary target, so
    this cap is only meant to catch the case where live tracking has drifted

def load_speed_profile_csv(csv_path: str):
    """
    Load a pre-computed (x, y, v_target) speed profile exported by
    fsae_MPCTest's tuner/export_speed_profile.py.

    For a track that's already been mapped, this replaces curvature_speed()'s
    per-tick re-derivation with a lookup against an oracle profile computed
    once, offline, from the whole recorded map — the live-built centreline is
    frequently shorter than curvature_speed()'s own scan_end (perception FOV
    clips laterally on a corner before its forward window does), so this
    bypasses that shortfall for a track that's already known.

    Parameters
    ----------
    csv_path : str   Path to a CSV with header "x,y,psi,v_target" (comment
                      lines starting with '#' are skipped).

    Returns
    -------
    (path_X, path_Y, path_V) : tuple of np.ndarray, shape (n,)

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError, ValueError : bad csv_path or malformed contents.

def load_path_profile_csv(csv_path: str):
    """
    Load a pre-computed (x, y) path exported by fsae_MPCTest's
    tuner/export_speed_profile.py, for use as a drop-in replacement of the
    live planner's /fsae/planning/selected_trajectory centreline.

    For a track that's already been mapped, this removes the live planner
    (centerline_planner.py / boundary.py / cone_map.py) from the control loop
    entirely, isolating controller/plant tracking error from planner-induced
    path error.

    psi is exported but not returned here: MPCController._error_state()
    already derives path heading from consecutive waypoints (atan2 of the
    segment direction, the same convention centerline_planner.py's published
    PoseArray uses), so the (n,2) array below is a direct substitute for the
    live topic's path with no interface change to mpc_core.py.

    Parameters
    ----------
    csv_path : str   Path to a CSV with header "x,y,psi,v_target" (comment
                      lines starting with '#' are skipped).

    Returns
    -------
    path : np.ndarray, shape (n, 2)   [x, y] waypoints, global frame.

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError, ValueError : bad csv_path or malformed contents.

def load_path_heading_profile_csv(csv_path: str):
    """
    Load the SHAPED heading-lead reference profile (psi_target) exported by
    fsae_MPCTest's tuner/tools/raceline_optimizer.py — see
    late_turn_in_investigation.md Part 8/9 for the mechanism and
    MPCController.set_heading_profile() for how it's consumed.

    Separate from load_path_profile_csv (which returns only (x,y), an
    (n,2) array used directly as `path` everywhere in mpc_core.py,
    including CornerMap's curvature segmentation) so that call site's
    return shape never changes — this is an additive, opt-in lookup, not a
    replacement for the geometric path array.

    Row-aligned with load_path_profile_csv's own (x,y) output when given
    the SAME csv_path (both read the same file, same row order) — the
    caller is responsible for loading both from one file, not mixing
    sources.

    For a 4-column CSV (no psi_target column), degrades to the plain
    geometric heading — see _load_profile_csv's docstring for why that's a
    genuine no-op, not repeated here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    csv_path : str

def precomputed_speed_at(car_pos, path_X, path_Y, path_V) -> float:
    """
    Nearest-point lookup into a pre-computed speed profile (see
    load_speed_profile_csv()).

    Deliberately a plain nearest-point search, not a Frenet/arc-length
    projection: the profile is dense (see export script, default 1000 pts
    over a lap), so nearest-point error is small and this avoids needing the
    heading/tangent bookkeeping a proper Frenet projection would add for a
    speed lookup that only needs to be "close enough," unlike e_y/e_psi
    tracking error, which does need that precision.

    Parameters
    ----------
    car_pos : array-like, shape (2,)   Car's current [x, y] (global frame).
    path_X, path_Y, path_V : np.ndarray, shape (n,)   From load_speed_profile_csv().
