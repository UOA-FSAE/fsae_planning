"""
MPC path-tracking controller — standalone variant (bypasses fsds_bridge).

mpc_controller.py (this package's default `mpc` controller) forwards only the
MPC's steering command through the shared cmd_vel abstraction; fsds_bridge.py
computes throttle/brake from a simple speed-error P-loop against a
curvature-limited target, the same way it does for the Stanley controller.

This node is a DIFFERENT integration of the same MPCController
(mpc_core.MPCController): it publishes fs_msgs/ControlCommand directly, using
the MPC's own (steering, throttle, brake) output unchanged. That preserves the
offline-tuned longitudinal behaviour from the fsae_MPCTest repo's
tuner/offline_tuner.py and gui/simulation.py, which both drive the vehicle
plant with the MPC's own commanded acceleration (see that repo's
sim/rollout_core.py) — mpc_controller.py's accel-discarding design does not.

Ported from fsae_MPCTest's control_node.py (mirrored at
fsds_simulator/control/fsae_control/fsae_control/mpc_controller_standalone.py
in that repo, alongside its own copies of mpc_core.py/control_utils.py — that
directory is a staging area mirroring this package's own hierarchy, kept for
porting purposes only), which implements the same design against an older
ROS 2 topic/message interface; this is that same node updated for the
current fsae_planning topics/messages.

    out  /fsds/control_command                fs_msgs/ControlCommand

Because this node owns GO-gating, stale-command braking, and cone-proximity
braking itself (mirroring fsds_bridge.py's own logic against the same inputs),
do NOT launch fsds_bridge.py alongside this node — its output would be
published but never used, and it would race this node for
/fsds/control_command. Select this controller with `controller:=mpc_standalone`
in control.launch.py, which skips fsds_bridge for that mode.

CONTROL LOOP PHASES (see _control_loop)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Phase 1 — Hold at start line until GO signal received.
  Phase 2 — Emergency brake if the planner path is missing/stale (>PATH_TIMEOUT
            old) or has fewer than 2 points, or the SLAM pose hasn't arrived yet;
            also resets the MPC so it doesn't warm-start from a stale trajectory
            once the path returns. When path_map_path is set, the path can
            never be "stale" (see that param's declaration) — only the pose
            check still applies.
  Phase 3 — Normal MPC solve via MPCController.compute().
  Phase 4 — Cone-proximity brake override: hard-overrides the MPC's
            throttle/brake (not steering) if a cone is inside the dynamic
            braking corridor. After CONE_RESET_THRESHOLD seconds of
            continuous braking, the MPC is reset exactly once (edge-triggered
            on the rising duration threshold, re-armed once the brake clears).
  Phase 4a — Telemetry logging of the *final* (post-override) command.
  Phase 5 — Publish.
