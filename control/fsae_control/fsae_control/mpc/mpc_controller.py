MPC path-tracking controller.

A drop-in alternative to the Stanley controller: it follows the planned
centreline using one of two optimisers, constructed unconditionally in
__init__ (mpc_core.MPCController, a linear time-varying MPC, by default; or
nmpc_core.NMPCController when use_nmpc=true). Unlike Stanley (which reacts
to the instantaneous cross-track/heading error), the MPC plans a 1.25 s
horizon, which is what damps the high-speed left-right sway.

This node has TWO output modes, selected by the `standalone_output` ROS2
parameter (default true):

  standalone_output=false — forwards only the MPC's steering command through
    the car stack's shared cmd_vel abstraction (speed + steering_angle on
    /fsae/control/cmd_vel); fsds_bridge.py then computes throttle/brake from
    a simple speed-error P-loop against the curvature-limited target, the
    same way it does for the Stanley controller. Run fsds_bridge.py alongside
    this node in that mode.

  standalone_output=true — publishes fs_msgs/ControlCommand directly, using
    the MPC's own (steering, throttle, brake) output unchanged. That
    preserves the offline-tuned longitudinal behaviour from the fsae_MPCTest
    repo's tuner/offline_tuner.py and gui/simulation.py, which both drive the
    vehicle plant with the MPC's own commanded acceleration (see that repo's
    sim/rollout_core.py) — the false mode's accel-discarding design does not.
    This node also owns GO-gating, stale-command braking, and cone-proximity
    braking itself in this mode (mirroring fsds_bridge.py's own logic against
    the same inputs) — do NOT launch fsds_bridge.py alongside this node when
    standalone_output=true, its output would be published but never used,
    and it would race this node for /fsds/control_command.
    control.launch.py's `standalone_output` launch arg already handles this
    — it skips fsds_bridge automatically for this mode.

The standalone_output=true design was originally ported from an
fsae_MPCTest prototype implementing the same direct-ControlCommand approach
against an older ROS 2 topic/message interface, then merged into this single
node (with the false mode) so the two integrations share one file instead of
being selected by two separate launchable executables.

CONTROL LOOP PHASES (see _control_step)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Phase 1 (standalone_output=true only) — Hold at start line until GO signal
            received.
  Phase 2 — Emergency brake/reset if the planner path is missing/stale
            (>PATH_TIMEOUT old) or has fewer than 2 points, or the SLAM pose
            hasn't arrived yet; also resets the MPC so it doesn't warm-start
            from a stale trajectory once the path returns. When
            path_map_path is set, the path can never be "stale" (see that
            param's declaration) — only the pose check still applies. In
            standalone_output=true mode this publishes an explicit brake
            command; in false mode it publishes nothing and relies on
            fsds_bridge's own cmd_vel timeout to brake.
  Phase 3 — Normal MPC solve via MPCController.compute().
  Phase 4 (standalone_output=true only) — Cone-proximity brake override:
            hard-overrides the MPC's throttle/brake (not steering) if a cone
            is inside the dynamic braking corridor. After
            CONE_RESET_THRESHOLD seconds of continuous braking, the MPC is
            reset exactly once (edge-triggered on the rising duration
            threshold, re-armed once the brake clears).
  Phase 4a — Telemetry logging of the *final* (post-override) command.
  Phase 5 — Publish.

#
# SPEED_TARGET_RISE_RATE alone assumes the car can accelerate at that rate. From
# a standing start it cannot: the car does not break static friction for ~1 s,
# so the target ramps to ~7 m/s while the car is still stationary and banks a
# deficit it spends the next second chasing. The NMPC minimises one scalar cost
# over the horizon, so a speed error that large swamps the lateral term and the
# optimiser trades e_y away for speed it was never going to get — measured live
# as a sideways excursion at launch that self-corrects once the car is rolling.
#
# Capping the DEFICIT rather than gating on measured speed is deliberate. A gate
# of the form "hold the target while v_actual is near zero" deadlocks: no target
# means no speed error, which means no throttle, which means the car never moves
# and the gate never opens. Holding at v_actual + DEFICIT_MAX always leaves a
# real speed error, so throttle still commands and the launch still happens; the
# ramp resumes by itself as the car closes the gap.
#
# Not specific to launch: the same rule stops the target running away after a
# spin or a heavy brake, for the same reason.
SPEED_TARGET_DEFICIT_MAX = 2.5
# Max rate (m/s^2) at which curvature_speed()'s OWN output (v_curv, the live
# per-tick geometry-derived target, NOT the precomputed-track oracle lookup)
# may fall, applied before the tracking-error gate. curvature_speed() is a
# pure per-tick function with no memory of its own last output, and its
# docstring already documents that the live planner path (re-fit every
# frame) carries a few cm of lateral wiggle that survives its internal
# denoising often enough to swing v_curv by 3-10 m/s in a single 50 ms tick
# even on a straight or gentle bend (measured live 2026-09-15, see
# planner_only_speed_target_oscillation.md) -- SPEED_TARGET_RISE_RATE does
# not catch this, it only bounds the composed target's RISE, and this same
# noise is the actual DROP.
#
# FIRST attempt (2026-09-15) sized this at A_BRAKE_PLAN (control_utils.py,
# 5.0 m/s^2), reasoning that curvature_speed()'s own braking-distance
# propagation already assumes that deceleration is enough to plan a genuine
# corner's slowdown, so a cap at that rate should never bind on real
# braking. That reasoning had a gap: it assumes the target had the full
# scan-window distance to ramp down over, but the corner speed can firm up
# to its true low value only once the car is already close (after the noisy
# early-window estimate settles), leaving less runway than the planning
# assumption presupposes. Measured live the same day: with the 5.0 cap in
# place, the car entered the first corner at ~17 m/s and took 3+ seconds to
# reach the ~2.5 m/s target, spinning out well before it got there
# (e_psi -> -98 deg, stalled). 5.0 m/s^2 was capping GENUINE required
# braking, not just noise.
#
# Sized instead at MAX_BRAKE (mpc_core.py, 7.0 m/s^2, matching
# vehicle_physics.max_accel_brake): the car's actual achievable braking
# deceleration, not a conservative planning-time assumption. This still
# smooths a single noisy tick's collapse (which asks for far more than 7.0
# m/s^2 worth of change) across a few ticks, but no longer throttles a
# genuine hard-braking need down below what the car can physically do.
V_CURV_FALL_RATE = 7.0
# TEMPORARY: disables curvature_speed() in the live (no precomputed-profile)
# branch below, falling back to a flat v_max instead. Set False to restore

# Max rate (gate-units/s, gate in [floor, 1.0]) at which

# active band can compound with a simultaneously falling curvature-based
# speed target into a sharp single-tick v_desired drop that bypasses
# SPEED_TARGET_RISE_RATE (that limiter only bounds RISES), producing erratic
# a_cmd right after. Rate-limiting the gate itself spreads the same total
# slowdown over several ticks instead of one, keeping the safety response

        Weighted-cost breakdown of every term the MPC actually solved this
        tick (error^2 * effective weight, as a share of its own GROUP's sum,
        see `group` below), plus the true solved objective and solve_ms.
        Debug-only, for live_viz.py's bar-graph panel(s).

        Grouped rather than one shared 0-100% scale: tracking errors
        (metres/radians), input effort (the command itself) and input rate
        (change per tick) are wildly different magnitudes squared against
        their own weights, so e.g. a steering-rate term of a few
        milliradians/tick will always round to ~0% next to a 0.3 m lateral
        error even when the rate cost is the one actually dominant within
        its own group -- comparing within a group is the only comparison
        that's meaningful. live_viz.py draws one 100% bar-graph per group.

        The `terms` breakdown is step-0-only (the current tick's
        instantaneous errors/rates/command, not summed over the horizon) for
        both solvers, so it stays an "at a glance, which term is biggest
        right now" signal, not a horizon-summed one. The tracking group also
        carries two synthetic combined entries, 'steering' and 'accel',
        each that input's effort + rate-of-change step-0 cost folded into
        one bar (their constituent steer_effort/accel_effort/delta_u_steer/
        delta_u_accel entries are kept too, for the effort/rate panels).

        `horizon_terms`, published separately, IS the true full-horizon
        per-term cost (see mpc_core.py's _compute_cost_breakdown /
        nmpc_core.py's _cost_breakdown), each shown as a share of
        total_cost -- the exact full-horizon scalar each solver minimised
        (cp.Problem.value for the LTV-QP, the SQP's own converged objective
        for NMPC). These percentages are directly comparable to each other
        (unlike the step-0 `terms` breakdown above), but do NOT sum to
        exactly 100%/total_cost: the soft track-boundary slack cost is
        deliberately excluded from horizon_terms (unused in this debug
        display) even though it's still part of total_cost.

        Falls back to the static MPCParams weight when no corner-blended
        "_eff" value is in last_telemetry (always true for NMPC, which has
        no blending step for Q/R).
