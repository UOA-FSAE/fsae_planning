    back onto the end so downstream lookahead / speed scans never run off the
    array at the wrap seam.  car_pos is prepended as the near anchor (matching
    the convention used by build_local_path / build_path_walls).

    When `wall_segs` (same-colour cone-wall segments, see boundary.build_wall_

    the figure-8 through the opening rather than cutting across the cone rings.

    reachable point ahead whose loop tangent is most aligned with the approach
    direction.  The car therefore merges onto the circle along a tangent — a
    smooth join into the turn — instead of driving at the closest point and
