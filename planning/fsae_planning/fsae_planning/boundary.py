Boundary detection: cone-wall mesh centreline planner.

build_path_walls  — the planner.  Connects same-colour cones into a wall mesh,
                    generates one midpoint per anchor-side cone via exclusive
                    nearest-neighbour matching, then chains them with a greedy
                    walk that penalises steps crossing the wall mesh.  The chain
                    is clamped to a fixed arc-length horizon and smoothed into a
                    centreline.

    Return midpoints from an exclusive nearest-neighbour match between blue
    and yellow cones within max_dist metres.

    The denser side (more cones in view) is used as the anchor: every anchor
    cone claims its single nearest still-unclaimed opposite-colour cone, so no
    opposite-colour cone can be shared between multiple midpoints.  This
    matters most in corners, where the tighter-radius boundary has cones
    closer together than the outer one — under plain all-pairs distance
    matching, one outer cone falls within range of several inner cones and
    fans out into several midpoints pulling in different directions, which
    stays jagged even after spline smoothing.  Anchor cones are matched in
    forward order (nearest to the car first) so exclusivity resolves in
    favour of the more immediately relevant matches.

    Validity filter: the blue cone must be to the LEFT of the yellow cone
    relative to the LOCAL track direction (not the car's instantaneous heading).
    This eliminates midpoints that would land inside a boundary wall, which arise
    when a same-colour cone from an adjacent parallel track is incorrectly paired.

    Using the local track direction rather than the car heading is what keeps
    CORNER midpoints: around a bend the boundary rotates away from the car's
    current heading, so a car-frame left/right test wrongly rejected the very
    apex cones and left the spline to cut a wide line across the gap.

    The local direction is estimated per anchor cone from its two SPATIALLY
    nearest same-colour neighbours (not its neighbours in the forward-sorted
    order).  This matters at tight corners with a narrow infield (hairpins,
    chicanes): the forward-sort mixes cones from the two legs of the bend, so a
    sort-order neighbour can be a cone on the OPPOSITE leg several metres across
    the infield.  The tangent then points across the track instead of along it,
    the left/right cross-product test inverts, and cross-infield cone pairs are
    wrongly accepted — producing midpoints that cut diagonally across the track
    (car drives off the map at the apex).  Spatially-nearest neighbours are
    always on the same leg, so the tangent stays along-track and the test holds.

    a hard 90° forward test: at an extreme bend the next along-track midpoint can
    sit well past 90° from the current heading, and a 90° ceiling dropped it and
