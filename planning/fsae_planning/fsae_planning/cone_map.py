"""
Persistent cone map — accumulates cone observations across the full session.

FSDS publishes cone positions in the global ENU map frame (same frame as
odometry), so no coordinate transform is required.  Each call to update()
merges new detections into the running map: an observation within MERGE_DIST
metres of an existing entry updates that entry's position (running average)
rather than adding a duplicate.  Cones that leave the sensor FOV are never
removed, so the map grows monotonically and historical walls are preserved.

    Merge obs array into store:

      but only once per physical cone: candidates are also checked against
